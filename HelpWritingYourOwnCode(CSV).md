# How to use the CSV Importer Code

### Getting Started

Copy the file [CSV_importer.py](CSV%20Reader/CSV_importer.py) into a folder. Then download the latest data from the Google Spreadsheet ([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f5YmNJC6xdTzdj7TKNBDY7rvzQkGlQaAcQJcLzm0Qz4/edit?usp=sharing)) as a CSV file (comma-separated file) and save it in the same folder. Be sure to change the variable `my_filename` to the name of the CSV file. Then run the example code and you should see it collate the temperature data. You can then use packages such as *matplotlib* to plot the data and analyse it.
